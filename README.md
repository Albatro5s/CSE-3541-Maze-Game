# CSE-3541-Maze-Game
 Procedurally generated Unity3D Maze Game

Project explores various styles of maze generation (BFS, Kruskal's, Prim's) and creates a navigable maze.

Implemented a first-person controller that rotates with mouse or gamepad. 

The maze size can be changed as long as it remains square. The player starts in the far corner of the maze.

There are collectable coins that bob and spin and are scored at the top left of the screen.

When exiting out of the "arrow door" on the opposite end of the maze, a game over notifciation displays in the top left below your score.
